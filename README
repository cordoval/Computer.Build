This project is a fork of Computer.Build.

Initially the former Computer.Build project was a tool for generating VHDL
hardware descriptions of microprocessors using a high-level domain-specific
language. It is implemented in both Ruby and Clojure as a case study in the
metaprogramming facilities of the two languages.

This fork is intended to be a complete framework for rapid hardware development.
We envision broader architectures not confined to processor-based architectures.

You are most welcome to contribute to this interesting project.
